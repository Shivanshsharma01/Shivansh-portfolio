        <h1 style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">Why do most websites have a .com domain extension?</h1>
        <h2>Domain suffix significance</h2>
        <p>Domain suffix defines the category of the website and .com is used for commercial purposes. Since the
            majority of the websites are used for commercial purposes .com is the oldest and widely used domain suffix
            in the world and it has become the gold standard for registration. 46% of the world's website use .com</p>
        <h2>Sign of trust</h2>
        <p>Since it is the most widely used domain suffix in the world, It gives credibility and comes with a sense of
            trust to the people because people see more of it in their daily life and link it to legitimacy. This is
            normal human behavior.</p>
        <h2>Sales</h2>
        <p>It is by far the most premium and expensive top-level domain. It has high demands in the market. It has very
            high resale prices too compared to other domain extensions.</p>
        <h2>TLD benefits</h2>
        <p>.com doesn't have any specific rules attached to it like if you have to buy a .us domain extension you have
            to prove your residency in the US but you can literally go global with .com. This is a big reason big
            companies or startups go with it as it has no restrictions or rules tied to it.</p>
        <h2>SEO benefits</h2>
        <p>The main work of SEO is to show the most relevant website to the user and search engines are known to rank
            .com websites better than country-specific domain extensions in universal search results. A URL needs to be
            memorable and sometimes people just assume that you have a .com domain suffix this gives an upper edge to
            the website</p>
        <h2>Issues</h2>
        <p>One of the issues with the .com domain suffix is its availability. In most cases .com will be sold for your
            business name and it will hard to get.</p>
